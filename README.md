# Introduction

The scripts and configuration files above are examples of my work.  My name is Berry Sizemore.

# Examples

## File Move

This script (de/un)compresses gzip file(s) and does housekeeping.

### Considerations

The need for failure awareness is paramount second only to security.  We can have it output failures, warnings and other data into log files for future analysis, have a monitor for disk failure, monitors for out-of-band permission changes, or network resource failures.

## Unattended Install of BEA

Even older application servers can be installed by automation.

## Notes

There are also notes in the portfolio sometimes.
